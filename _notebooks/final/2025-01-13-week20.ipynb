    "You might have noticed how I added a few comments in the last 3 lines. When I did my first implementation of this method, it seems to update the `GameControl.lastLocalStorageTime` key value by appending the `GameEnv.time` value to the end of the locally stored value, causing the time in game to quickly increase to Infinity. *Apparently*, I forgot that local storage values were stored as strings (which was written in the help system doc file that I WROTE). Anyhow, the fix is quick: just parse `savedTime` as an integer, hence the `parseInt(savedTime, 10)`, where `10` indicates base 10 (decimal). Also, I love ternary operators!\n",

    "Was encountering quite a few bugs with NaN (which I presume was also to do with localStorage), hence the error handling. I ended up scrapping this idea because it was causing the game to run excruciatingly slow. Frankly, I'm not even sure it would have worked because the timer is still handled via the game loop refresh rate."
