    "Over these 24 weeks, I've had to use a lot of Github. My progression started with commiting directly to Github and editing files there a few years ago (maybe in 8th grade or so), until I realized you could push from an IDE like VSCode. In the summer before high school, I actually learned a few git functions: `git pull`, `git push`, `git commit`, `git config`, and `git log`. That's it. But it did get me from point A to point B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then it came to CSSE 2, where I actually had to learn real development. Here, I learned merging, branching, forking, and a bunch of other random stuff I discovered as I went. I can now somewhat proficiently perform merges, PRs, force pushes, resolve merge conflicts, create issues, etc. all from the CLI! Think stuff like `git merge`, `git branch`, `git fetch`, `rebase`, `git reflog`, `git blame`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've also learned the development process (detailed in one of the pbl documents) and some best practices just from viewing some other projects (viz. the Linux Kernel). This was probably the most I learned from CSSE, actually (+ all the development lifecycles and how to work with other people).\n",

    "Although the project didn't go to well improvement wise, I actually think I learned the most from the development life cycle; that is, handling PRs, managing development teams, etc. This also happened to be my first hands on experience with an entire OOP connected codebase, so that was cool to learn; I expect it's a LOT harder to familiarlize yourself with some larger codebases (from experience). I've also come to a very prominent conclusion: I'm definitely not cut out for managerial rules."

Aside from learning Github, this is the first time I've actually put OOP into practice in a connected codebase. Naturally, this inspired me to try a bit more. And so, I developed a couple statically built Jekyll projects:\n",

    "That's not too shabby, but there's one thing I think REALLY got everything going. OOP with JS was a good starting point, until I discovered that Rust does this in its own little, fickle way. Instead of classes and methods, you get `structs`, `impls`, `mods`, `enums`, `traits`, etc. But, that first catalyst and stepping stone was JS's `classes`, `methods`, and `statics`. In fact, I made a [lesson](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/portfolio_2025/csse/javascript/fundamentals/classes/intro/) on these (requiring me to read the MDN Web Docs) which actually even *started* my interest in the OOP side of programming."

Learning the codebase and how the classes connected between all the files was pretty cool, and I think it's helped me now understand some larger, more sophisticated code systems."
