    "## My Project\n",
    "\n",
    "For N@TM, I wasn't all too proud of my contributions to the game, and I wanted to show some projects I thought were interesting. So, I decided to show my webapp project. \n",
    "\n",
    "The project connects a python script that uses the Selenium webdriver to traverse Synergy and fetch grades to a webapp via Tauri/Rust, using JS/HTML to build the GUI. The current Python script works by fetching grades and iterating through indexes until it accesses one out of bounds, in which case it knows there's no more assignments to iterate over (VERY unsafe code, but oh well, I haven't come up with a solution).\n",
    "\n",
    "Around an hour before N@TM, I spent quite a while fixing some environmental variables (remember this) and moving the codebase onto my laptop from the desktop (learned a bit of network discovery stuff for this!). After I got it moved 30 minutes before, Python on my laptop wasn't working. After around 20 minutes of troubleshooting, I FINALLY realized that Python runs with the alias `py`, not `python` or `python3`. WHY. Anyhow, it was too late to fix some other bugs that basically crippled functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "I arrived early at N@TM with a broken webapp, but was able to fix the issues after installing a missing dependency (for environmental variables, but python decided not to tell me this was the problem; instead, it gave me a massive stack message error). With that fixed, I realized I didn't have the Rust toolchain installed on my host for my laptop, only WSL. Unforunately, it was too late to install the complete Cargo toolchains + few 100 packages required to build the project. This wouldn't have mattered anyway, since the webapp, upon submitting credentials, would freeze for 1-2 minutes and return unparsed data (the data parser module was WIP).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the actual presentation, I just showed the Rust/JS/HTML code that builds the frontend, but didn't actually run it, and for the demo, I just ran the python code (which actually shows enough if you can read terminal outputs)."

    "I happened to see the barcode scanner project, and I actually inquired about the Raspberry PI they used. I happened to assume they used MicroPython, and it appeared to be a pretty cool applicatin of embedded systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what really captivated my interest was the crypto/stock simulators. I'm not as so much interested in the simulators than I am the actual content. I'm somewhat inspired now to actually try writing my own blockchain and infrastructure to handle proof of work transactions, exchanges, etc. in Rust..."

    "> very cool but not very uh undertabek\n",
    "\n",
    "*Very cool, but not very, uh, understandable.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, it was pretty cool (totally not biased). The \"not understandble\" part comes from my explanation to a non tech savvy person, and admittedly, I'm not able to explain these topics very well simply. I tried pretty hard, but oh well. Naturally, it's much harder to explain when the output comes as a giant block of text in the terminal (no GUI!).\n",

    "> didnt work the guy spoke very interestingly. couldve been more efficient\n",
    "\n",
    "*Didn't work; the guy spoke very interestingly.*\n",
    "\n",
    "It actually did work, it just didn't work towards the beginning. Glad to hear my speaking was interesting this time around, but I guess it sort of depends on the person. \n",
    "\n",
    "> really interesting application of school life into the project, great effort!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Really interesting application of school life in the project. Great effort!*\n",
    "\n",
    "Cool.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Get a portal running. 2 minutes is too slow. Creative idea though, you thought outside of the box\n",
    "\n",
    "This was probably the feedback closest to what I was explaining and working on. A portal here would refer to some sort of GUI to enter credentials somewhat securely and view all the data in a visual format. Also, the 2 minutes part is partially because I told them it took around 2 minutes to load. The Tauri app takes a really long time to send and fetch all the data by running the Python task. Connecting the Rust code with JS/HTML one way and Python the other way without correctly multithreading and running Python in the background freezes the applicatin. I tried writing some multithreading code, but the problem still remains. This is definitely something to look at. As for the latter part of the comment, thanks!\n",
    "\n",
    "> Awesome stuff, too advanced for my brain lol, but I love the effort and progress you made!\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks for the compliment."
