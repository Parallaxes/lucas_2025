    "title: CSP Period 4 Unit 3.7.2 Nested Conditionals Javascript Lesson\n",
    "description: Nested conditionals in JavaScript allow for more complex decision-making by placing one conditional statement inside another. This structure enables a program to check additional conditions only if the previous condition is true, creating a layered decision process. In this lesson, students will learn how to implement nested if, else if, and else statements to create more specific control flows in their programs. Through examples and exercises, they will gain a deeper understanding of how to manage multiple conditions effectively, enhancing the logic of their code.\n",

    "Objective:\n",
    "Write a JavaScript program that randomly assigns a student grade level (from 0 to 12) and outputs the school level the student would be in (kindergarten, elementary, middle, or high school). The program also identifies if the student is in their last year at their current school level.\n",

    "Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a JavaScript file (e.g., schoolLevel.js).\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate a Random Grade:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Math.random() to generate a random number between 0 to 1 and multiply it by 12, which will represent the student’s grade.\n",
    "Round the number to the nearest whole number using Math.round().\n",
    "Store this number in a variable called grade.\n",

    "Middle School for grades 6–8\n",
    "High School for grades 9–12\n",
